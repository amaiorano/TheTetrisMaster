1.0 - Changes

<< 2.2 November 23, 2016 >>

- Add drop shadow on blocks
- Introduce fixed delay before new block drops down right after block
  placement
- Made the drop delay intervals a little longer because it was much too
  fast
- Change next block randomization to follow more standard "random shuffle
  of 7 pieces" sequences
- Make pressing up immediately place the current block in straight line
  downwards
- Introduce extra delay after initial move left/right of block to make it
  easier to control placement of pieces

<< 2.1 - November 10, 2016 >>

- Removed dependency on 8.3 filenames in theme files so that the game works
  on modern systems that doesn't enable this feature.

<< 2.0 - March 9, 2004 >>

- Rewrote to use OpenGL instead of the little supported VESA 2.0 graphics mode.
  Also changed the core to match the tetris specification more closely, which
  is available here:
  http://www.colinfahey.com/2003jan_tetris/tetris_standard_specifications.htm
  
- Rewrote TTM Theme Launcher in MFC.

<< beta 3.1 - January 29, 2000 >>

- Made the Theme Launcher window dissapear when a theme is launched, and
  reappear when the theme is ended.

<< beta 3.0 - December 22, 1999 >>

- Fixed up sound so that three sounds can play at the same time.

- Stopped the music when you lose so you hear "Game Over" sound without 
  music.

- Music stops when you press Pause now.

- Changed the line removing algorithm to run faster. Some of you might
  notice a slight speed increase.

- Added a Game Speed option - choose between 0 to 30 (slowest to fastest).

- Added 3 new screen modes, so now you can choose from 4 - Normal 320x240,
  Normal 640x480, Scanlines at 640x480, and Stretched 640x480! Those 
  people who couldn't play TTM because their graphics cards did not 
  support low resolution Vesa 2.0 mode (i.e. Matrox G400), or who needed 
  a TSR or Scitech Display Doctor to play, can now try out these new 
  modes! Select your screen mode from the Options menu in the Theme 
  Launcher.


<< beta 2.3 - November 27, 1999 >>

- Added a "Keyboard Sensitivity" section to the Options menu in the Theme
  Launcher. Now you can adjust how quickly the pieces respond to a
  keypress!

<< beta 2.2 - November 24, 1999 >>

- Ladies and gentlement, check out the icons for the Theme Launcher and the
  Theme Editor! Basically, that's all that's new in this version.

==========================================================================
1.1 - Description

The Tetris Master is simply a Tetris clone. The difference with this one,
however, is you can select different "Themes", just like Windows Themes. 
Each theme changes the following:

* Background graphic
* Block graphics
* Window graphic
* Window transparency level
* Music
* Sound
* Font color
* Font shadowing

You can also use the Theme Editor to create your own themes! Just run
"TTM Theme Editor.exe" and have fun! If you need any help, just press F1
and the on-line help window will open.

To play the actual game, run "TTM Theme Launcher.exe" and not 
"Tetris.exe", because the latter will not allow you to select themes.

==========================================================================
1.2 - System Requirements

Here are the base requirments for The Tetris Master to run properly:

- Pentium CPU
- Windows 9X operating system (there are sound and graphics problems with 
  NT)
- SB16 or compatible sound card
- VESA 2.0 compliant Video Card (download Scitech Display Doctor at
   www.scitech.com if your card is not Vesa 2.0 compliant)

==========================================================================
2.0 - Game Controls

Here are a list of the game controls at this moment. Eventually, you will
be able to select your own.

Arrows: Move block
'A': Rotate block left
'S': Rotate block right
'P': Pause (try this, it's pretty neat!)
'ESC': Quit

4.0 - Special Thanks and Greetings

I would like to thank the following people for all their help and
encouragement! Without you guys, The Tetris Master would probably have
remained a figment of my imagination! This list has no particular order,
as is in no way exhaustive - if I forgot anyone, just yell at me = )

Simon, Justus, Nathan, Ken, John IV, Jeff K., Jeff C., and of course, Nat 
and her beautiful sisters, Jessica and Caroline.

Thank you all so much!

Tony
